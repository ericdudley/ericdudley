## Likes, but worse, or better?

Social media likes have remained mostly the same for the past decade. First you could like a post, that was it. Then you could like a comment on a post. Then you could choose between a like or a heart. You'd think that in such a long time, someone would have gotten more creative!

Today, we'll be exploring some ideas that could revolutionize the way the tech industry implements likes... Or it might just make them worse. Let's find out!

### Idea 1: More than one like per user

Why only allow one like per user? If someone is going to post their stamp collection and only get a few likes from their fellow philatelists, why not let them get more likes from the same people? This would be a great way to show your appreciation for a post without having to comment on it.

#### Tradeoffs

| Pros       | Cons       |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| More likes | More likes |
| More likes | More likes |
| More likes | More likes |

### Idea 2: Positional likes

If someone posts a picture of their puppy with their baby, people are almost definitely going to like the post for the cute puppy. Why not let them like the puppy specifically? This would provide more information to the poster about what people like about their post. It would also allow people to like the puppy without having to like the baby.

### Idea 3: Infinite hierarchy of likes

Have you ever gotten a like from someone on a post, but then wanted to like their like to show your appreciation? This would allow you to do that. You could even like their like of your like, and so on. This would allow you to show your appreciation for someone's appreciation of your appreciation of their appreciation of your post.

### Idea 4: Conditional likes

Let's say you are in a friend group, and Alice and Bob got in an argument, so you're not sure if you should like Alice's post, upsetting Bob. Conditional likes would allow you to say, "Like Alice's post, but only if Bob also likes it." This would allow you to show your support for Alice without upsetting Bob. You might also not want to look lame, so you could say "Like Alice's post, but only if at least 5 other people also like it."

### Idea 5: Unconditional likes

Are there people in your life who you just always want to support, regardless of what they're doing? Unconditional likes allows you to say, "Like Alice's posts, no matter what." As soon as Alice posts, you'll automatically like it. This would allow you to show your support for Alice without having to think about it.

### Idea 6: Secret Dislikes as Likes

This one is for those who secretly harbor the wish to dislike posts. The platform shows you’ve liked the post, but if you click in a specific pattern, it registers as a dislike on the backend. The user sees a like, but the algorithm counts it as a dislike, affecting the visibility of the post. A sneaky way to navigate social etiquette, while expressing your true feelings. But shh, it’s a secret feature.

### Conclusion

Imagine this: You wake up, grab your phone, and see a post from your dear friend Alice, who has shared a photo of her breakfast bagel. But this is no ordinary post, thanks to the new wave of social media interactions.

First, you give her post "extra" love by spamming the 'like' button, sending over a dozen likes her way because one just doesn't cut it for such a culinary masterpiece. You then zoom in on the particularly appetizing cream cheese and smoked salmon part of the bagel, giving a positional like that screams, "this part, I like this part right here!"

Suddenly, you receive a notification. Someone appreciated your keen eye for good food, and they've liked your like. You grin and like their like, creating an endless loop of mutual appreciation. As this goes on, you notice Bob has liked Alice's post, giving you the green light to activate your "conditional like," effectively saying, "If Bob's in, I'm in."

But then, there's your cousin, the one who posts endless pictures of their pet hedgehog. You've set up an unconditional like for them because family supports family, right? Even if it's the hundredth hedgehog photo this week.

Lastly, amidst this frenzy of advanced liking, you stumble upon a post that rubs you the wrong way. Remembering the secret feature, you tap out a sly pattern, delivering a 'like' that's not really a like. It's the perfect crime.

By the time you finish your own breakfast, your simple morning scroll has turned into a whirlwind of nuanced communication and camaraderie, all thanks to a few imaginative twists on the humble 'like' button. Social media has never been this personal or this fun!
