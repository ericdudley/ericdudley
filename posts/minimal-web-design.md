There's something beautiful about minimal web design.

In a world of bloated JavaScript frameworks and complex build systems,
sometimes the best approach is to go back to basics:

- Raw HTML
- Simple CSS
- No JavaScript unless absolutely necessary
- Fast loading times
- Works on any device
- Accessible by default

This website is an experiment in that philosophy.
The entire codebase is less than 300 lines of Go code.
No package.json, no node_modules, no build step.

Just pure, simple code that does exactly what it needs to do.

The web was built on simple technologies,
and sometimes simple is exactly what we need.

Performance benefits:
- Instant page loads
- Works offline (once cached)
- Minimal bandwidth usage
- No JavaScript errors
- Compatible with any browser

Maintenance benefits:
- Easy to understand
- Easy to modify
- No dependencies to update
- No security vulnerabilities from third-party code
- Will work for decades without changes
