This is my first blog post on my new minimal website!

I decided to build this using pure Go with zero dependencies. 
The goal is to have a "forever" codebase that will work for decades
without needing updates or dealing with dependency hell.

Some key features:
- File system based routing
- Simple frontmatter for metadata
- Raw HTML output with minimal styling
- Zero external dependencies

The content you're reading right now is stored as plain text
and gets rendered inside a <pre> tag to preserve formatting.

This approach keeps things simple and maintainable.
No complex markdown parsing, no heavy frameworks,
just pure simplicity.

Looking forward to writing more posts!
