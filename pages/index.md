I've been a professional software engineer since 2018, but building things with code since 2010.

Currently living in San Francisco, working on robotics at [DoorDash Labs](https://labs.doordash.com), and occasionally building 
some fun things in my spare time.

If you're here professionally check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-dudley-894721106/) or [my resume](/resume.pdf).

If you're here for the occasional fun things, check out my latest posts in my [blog](/blog.html).
